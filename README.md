Hello world,

My name is Kirk Rollins. I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana but spent most of my youth in the small town of Church Point, Louisiana. I am married to Mary Beth and we have a child together named Oliver. Nowadays we enjoy spending time with him after work and when he will let us. I personally enjoy exercise and playing on the computer.
